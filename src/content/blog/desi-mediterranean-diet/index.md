## ⚡ TL;DR  
Mediterranean isn’t a cuisine — it’s a **philosophy**: whole grains, veggies, healthy fats, lean proteins, herbs. Swap in Indian staples like dal, millets, mustard oil, ghee, and spices. Drop the junk. Eat like your dadi — with a modern twist.

---

## 1. Whole Grains, Desi Style  
**Go for:** Brown rice, jowar, bajra, ragi, whole wheat atta, even quinoa.  
**Why it matters:** High fiber = better digestion, longer energy, improved insulin sensitivity.  
**Bonus:** Millets are local, sustainable, and cheap.

---

## 2. Plant Power: Indian Proteins  
**Use:** Dals (moong, toor, masoor), chole, rajma, sprouts, tofu.  
**Why:** They’re clean, heart-friendly, and anti-inflammatory.  
**What to avoid:** Paneer overload. It’s still saturated fat-heavy. Go easy.

---

## 3. Smart Desi Fats  
**Use:**  
– Mustard oil (omega-3 rich)  
– Sesame oil (heat-stable)  
– Groundnut oil (classic, earthy)  
– Ghee (moderate amounts — it’s a superfat when used right)

---

## 4. Fruits and Veggies That Actually Grow Here  
**Veggies:** Palak, lauki, bhindi, baingan, gobhi, karela, methi  
**Fruits:** Pomegranate, guava, papaya, mango (in season), jamun  

**Why:** More antioxidants. More flavor. Way cheaper than blueberries.

---

## 5. Lean Proteins, Indian Approved  
**Go for:**  
– Grilled fish (tandoori pomfret, rohu)  
– Skinless chicken (masala roasted or curry)  
– Eggs (boiled, poached, sunny side up)  

Skip deep frying. Grill, bake, or pan-fry with minimal oil.

---

## 6. Spices = Medicine  
**Use daily:** Turmeric, cumin, coriander, hing, cardamom, clove, fenugreek  
**Why:** Anti-inflammatory, digestion-boosting, antimicrobial.  
**Don’t underestimate:** Your masala dabba is more powerful than a pharmacy shelf.

---

## 7. Cut the Crap (Processed & Sugary Stuff)  
**Avoid:** Packaged snacks, white bread, processed cheese, bakery biscuits, sugary chai  
**Why:** Inflammation, insulin spikes, and belly fat love this stuff. You shouldn’t.

## 8. Slow Down. Eat Better.  
Mindful eating =  
– Better digestion  
– Satiety awareness  
– Less bingeing  

Eat with hands. Sit on the floor if you can. Focus on the food. Don’t scroll while you chew.

---

## 9. Sample Desi-Med Meal Plan

**🥣 Breakfast:**  
Vegetable upma with groundnuts + one guava  

**🍛 Lunch:**  
Brown rice + rajma + sautéed methi + cucumber raita  

**🥜 Snack:**  
Handful of almonds + tulsi chai (no sugar)  

**🥗 Dinner:**  
Tandoori fish + bajra roti + carrot-cabbage salad + lemon wedge  

---

## ✅ Conclusion  
The Mediterranean diet isn’t about fancy olive oil and feta.  
It’s about balance, simplicity, whole foods, and slowing down.  

**Desi ingredients are already aligned** with its core. You don’t need to import health — you just need to rediscover it.  

Eat local. Cook simple. Season well. Slow down.  

**That’s real fusion. That’s the Desi-Med way.**
