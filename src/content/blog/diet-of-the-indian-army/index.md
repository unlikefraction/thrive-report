## ⚡ TL;DR  
The Indian Army doesn’t “diet” — it fuels. Meals are built for survival, endurance, and power across extreme environments. From ghee-laced puris at base to 8000-kcal rations at Siachen, everything is functional, not fashionable. Soldiers train hard. They eat harder. This is battlefield nutrition, desi-style.

## 1. Standard Meals at Base Camps  
Daily meals for soldiers stationed at camps and cantonments are hearty and energy-dense:

- **Breakfast:** Puri-sabji, boiled eggs, or paratha-curd  
- **Lunch:** Roti/rice, dal, sabzi, and meat (chicken/mutton)  
- **Dinner:** Similar to lunch, often includes soup or curd  

Balanced in **carbs for energy**, **protein for muscle recovery**, and **fats for sustained stamina**.

## 2. Combat Rations & MREs  
When deployed, soldiers carry DRDO-developed **Meals Ready-to-Eat (MREs)**:

- Dishes: Chicken biryani, dal makhani, rajma, veg pulao, mutton curry, sooji halwa  
- Shelf life: 12 months  
- Comes with: Portable stoves, fuel tablets, water-purification kits  

Compact, self-heating, and shelf-stable — made for mobility and survival.

## 3. Specialized Ration Packs  
Different missions = different rations:

- **One-Man Combo Pack:** ~4100 kcal/day  
- **Mini Combo Pack:** ~1520 kcal  
- **Survival Pack:** ~2400 kcal via bars, chikki, dry snacks  
- **MBT Pack (for tank crews):** Feeds 4 soldiers for 72 hrs at 4000 kcal/day  

Designed for operational flexibility, caloric density, and climate resilience.

## 4. Nutrition Science in Uniform  
The Indian Army doesn’t chase trends — it chases **performance**:

- **High protein:** For repair and muscle mass  
- **Complex carbs:** For slow-release energy  
- **Moderate fat:** For high-calorie efficiency  
- **Hydration:** Strict protocols for heat and altitude  

Every ingredient is chosen based on bioavailability, shelf stability, and physical demand.

## 5. Fueling High Altitude Warfare  
In terrains like Siachen:

- Daily need = **6000–8000 kcal**  
- Focus: High-fat, high-carb, easy-to-eat foods (nuts, chocolate, dry fruits)  
- Appetite drops at altitude — so foods are compact, calorie-dense, and hyper-palatable  
- Special high-altitude MREs are tailored for cold and oxygen-deprived conditions  

Food = fuel + survival.

## 6. Training: Body and Mind  
A soldier’s routine is no joke. Their strength is built in sweat and pain:

- **Daily:**  
  - Run 5–7 km  
  - 100–200 pushups  
  - 200+ situps  
  - 10+ pull-ups  
  - 200+ squats  

- **Elite Forces (Para SF):**  
  - 90-day brutal selection  
  - 100 km endurance marches with 25kg packs  
  - Sleep-deprivation drills, survival training, live combat simulations

## ✅ Conclusion  
The Indian Army’s diet is a **functional fuel system** — not a lifestyle choice.  
Every bite is calculated for strength, endurance, and survival.  
In battle, nutrition isn’t aesthetic. It’s tactical.  
Want real discipline? Eat and train like a soldier.
