## ⚡ TL;DR  
Brands lie. Food labels are full of tricks. Ignore the front — flip it. If sugar, shortenings, or junk are in the first 3 ingredients, drop it. Look at serving size, added sugar, sodium, protein. Use tools like ChatGPT, FoodSwitch, or Open Food Facts to scan and dodge the BS. Read labels. Not ads.

## 1. Ingredients First  
Always start here.  

- Ingredients are listed **by weight**. First 3 = most of the product.  
- If it starts with **sugar, maida, or shortenings**, it’s junk food dressed up as health.  
- Long, synthetic-sounding names? Put it back.

## 2. Spot Hidden Sugars  
Sugar wears disguises. It never walks in with its real name.  

Look for:
- High fructose corn syrup  
- Dextrose  
- Maltose  
- Glucose  
- Fruit concentrate  
- Agave nectar  
- Anything ending in **"-ose"**

More names = more deception.

## 3. Don’t Trust the Front  
“Low-fat.” “Natural.” “High in protein.”  

These are **marketing lines**, not health facts.  
The front is meant to **sell**. Not inform.  

Flip the pack. Always. Look for:
- The full ingredient list  
- Actual sugar per serving  
- Realistic serving size (they always lowball this)

## 4. Break Down Nutrition Info  
This is the part brands hope you don’t read.  

- Check **serving size** — most snacks are **2+ servings**, but you eat the whole pack.  
- Look at **sugar, sodium, and fat** per serving. Then do the math.  
- More **protein and fiber** = better.  
- More **sugar and salt** = trash.
